hab-mqtt2pg
===========

This application is part of our **personal** "Home-Automation Bus".  It
persists MQTT messages to a [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com) or plain
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

The application runs on the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) platform. The source
code is written in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/index) and build
with [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs). There is also a
deployment recipe to be used with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) which
will install a systemd service on a recent Ubuntu installation.
